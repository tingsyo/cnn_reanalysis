# Representation Learning for Re-analysis Data

This repository consists of utilities, templates, and examples for applying representation learning on re-analysis data in NetCDF format.

The goal of this project is to provide a general guideline for applying machine learning, especially representation learning, tools on the main stream re-analysis data.

There are two major questions while people using re-analysis data:

1. What are the spatial-temporal features in the dataset?

2. Which **specific levels** (physical parameter at a particular pressure level) are important to the real-world phenomena I am interested in?

And we want to collect related works and tools for scientists to better solve their problems.
